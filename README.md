# Improving web site for better looking and fucionality 

The major editing I did to this page was more relatable to functionality on other devices ike cell phones or laptops since the web page was created purposely for desktops

# # Why did I edit this web page

Title, images, and also the text from the body didn’t change to fit on other devices it was messy and not enjoyable since everything was out of place 

### Main changes 

The main changes were done on the style.css by adding @media screen and changing padding, size, font, width, height, and some margins to be able to fit on specific devices. Some small mistakes on punctuation on the “Font family” were fixed aswell.
